Welcome to the official Github repository for Folsom Lake College's Data Science Club. This is where all projects will be stored open-source. Welcome to innovation.

### About the Data Science Club
Our club exists to innovate and push students toward a "learn by doing" model that exists in developer workplaces to remain competitive. This club is not for the faint of heart: we maintain a sharp learning curve and push our members to compete with industry standard in the fields of backend and frontend software development using data science methods.

This club is for students interested in programming, entrepreneurship, or design. We'll discuss data science methods such as introductory machine learning, data visualization, data mining, and many more subjects. This club exists to stand at the frontier of computer science. We'll engage in subfields of development highly desired by companies such as Uber, Google, Apple, and many more.

E-mail Rebekah at keelyrebe@gmail.com if you have any questions.

### Handling Projects
Projects are  managed in two categories:
  - Personal projects worked on with the Data Science Club under the "Users" folder
  - Team projects for collaboration under the "Projects" folder.

### Setting up Github, the easy way
If you're ambitious enough to [learn Git](http://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners), I'd recommend doing so for a more thorough understanding of using Github. If you would like to learn how to use Github without the terminal, I would instead recommend [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
