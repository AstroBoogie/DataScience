Welcome to the official Github repository for Folsom Lake College's Data Science Club. This is where all projects will be stored open-source. Welcome to innovation.

### About the Data Science Club
Our club exists to innovate and push students toward a "learn by doing" model that exists in developer workplaces to remain competitive. Data Science is a new field that was created in response to big data and the need for large-scale computing. It's most competitive in university environments as seen with [MIT](http://mitsloan.mit.edu/undergrad/explore-by-interest/business-analytics-and-operations-research/), [Berkeley](https://bids.berkeley.edu), or [Stanford](https://sdsi.stanford.edu). We plan on getting Data Science students into internships, top-tier universities, or the industry for their dream company or lab.

This club is for students interested in science, programming, entrepreneurship, or design. We'll discuss data science methods such as introductory machine learning, data visualization, data mining, and many more subjects. We'll engage in subfields of development highly desired by companies such as Uber, Google, Apple, and many more.

E-mail Rebekah at keelyrebe@gmail.com if you have any questions.

### Handling Projects
Projects are  managed in two categories:
  - Personal projects worked on with the Data Science Club under the "Users" folder
  - Team projects for collaboration under the "Projects" folder.

### Setting up Github, the easy way
For a thorough understanding of using Github, you can [learn Git](http://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners) here. If you'd like to learn how to use Github without the terminal, you should use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
