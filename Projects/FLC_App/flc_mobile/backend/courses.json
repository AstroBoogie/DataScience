Laboratory work will include characterization of organic molecules using modern analytical instrumentation such as (GC, GC/MS, NMR, FTIR, polarimetry, and HPLC) and the measurement of their physical properties.  Separation and purification of organic compounds will also be covered in the lab section; these techniques include distillation, recrystallization, preparative chromatography, liquid-liquid extraction and thin-layer chromatography.  This course requires that students purchase additional supplies such as a Gas Chromatography micro-syringe and safety goggles.  Students will need to purchase a lab journal to record students experimental information.  Students will also need to check with the instructor for supplemental lab supplies that may not be provided during check-in. (C-ID CHEM 150; Part of C-ID CHEM 160S)",

This course is designed for science majors, pre-medical, pre-dental, and pre-pharmacy majors.  Topics covered include the chemistry of ethers, epoxides, conjugated dienes, aromatic compounds, carbonyl compounds, enolate condensation, amines, phenols, condensation-polymerization reactions, and the chemistry of selected biologically important compounds such as proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. The course also includes continued application of spectroscopic methods (IR, NMR (theory and practice), and MS) applied to organic chemistry. Laboratory emphasis is on synthesis of organic compounds and their work-up and analysis.  Experiments include the preparation, isolation, quantitation, purification, identification and mechanism elucidation of the molecules synthesized.  Students will continue to expand their ability to operate and utilize a variety of modern chemical instrumentation - gas chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, Fourier transform - infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and polarimetry.  Students must purchase instructor produced supplements; Study guide for the approved lecture text; Stitch-bound, page-numbered laboratory notebook(s); model kit; American Chemical Society Study Guide for Organic Chemistry, approved safety goggles, gloves, gas chromatography syringe. a pair of approved safety goggles.
