The course covers the general principles of biology including:  methods of science, cell organization, genetics, evolution, ecology, biodiversity, and anatomy.  These principles are explored in more depth through the examination of additional topics which may include:  disease and epidemiology, physiological ecology, animal behavior, biotechnology, population growth and regulation, ecosystem ecology, and conservation biology.  Evolution and biodiversity are continuing themes included in each major topic.  The course is designed for non-science majors and is especially useful for liberal studies, elementary education, environmental studies, recreation, and similar majors.  Field trips scheduled outside of class time (including day-length weekend field trips) may be required. Students may be required to purchase eye protection and disposable gloves.",

Laboratory work will include characterization of organic molecules using modern analytical instrumentation such as (GC, GC/MS, NMR, FTIR, polarimetry, and HPLC) and the measurement of their physical properties.  Separation and purification of organic compounds will also be covered in the lab section; these techniques include distillation, recrystallization, preparative chromatography, liquid-liquid extraction and thin-layer chromatography.  This course requires that students purchase additional supplies such as a Gas Chromatography micro-syringe and safety goggles.  Students will need to purchase a lab journal to record students experimental information.

Conditioning exercises and drills will be incorporated to develop the physical skills and capabilities necessary to execute basic Hip Hop movement. The movements will be instructor choreographed, but will allow the opportunity for students to express their individuality and creativity by developing signature techniques, as well as group formations. Students will compete in small groups as part of the experience. The historical foundations of Hip Hop dance will also be examined with emphasis placed on the positive message that Hip Hop culture brings to todays society. No previous dance experience is necessary. Low traction, comfortable athletic shoes and loose fitting clothing will be required, and some students may wish to wear knee pads. This course was formerly known as Dance 311. This course is not open to students who have received credit for Dance 311.",

Students from various majors across the curriculum will have the opportunity to explore the important interconnections between literature, cultural studies, philosophy, art, art history, architectural studies, anthropology, sociology, psychology, and physics, all of which intersect in postmodern thought and fiction.",
